# TOMB5 Legacy
Fork of [tomb5](https://github.com/Trxyebeep/TOMB5) for the purpose of preserving the original Tomb Raider Chronicles source code.
- All fixes and unoriginal code were removed, with a few exceptions:
1) Things that fail the compilation process, or crash the game otherwise, such as uninitialized vars.
2) The software renderer.
3) Bink stuff.

Everything else is original and should behave exactly as the retail TRC executable.
